To create a mod file for your game, you can follow these steps:

Create a folder named mods in your game's root directory.

Inside the mods folder, create a new folder with the name of your mod.

Copy all the files related to your mod (e.g. classes, resources, etc.) into the mod folder.

Compress the mod folder into a ZIP file.

Change the extension of the ZIP file to .jar.

Your mod file is now ready to be loaded by your game. You can place the mod file in the mods folder and the game will automatically load it on startup.
